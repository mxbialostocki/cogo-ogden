# cogo-ogden

## use
`npm i`
then
`npm run dev`
browse to localhost:/8181 in your preferred browser.

### notes
I spent two hours and ten minutes on this, after accounting for some local machine issues that I didn't feel counted towards the excercise.

A user, in the browser, can submit a string of text to be evaluated against ogden words. Any rejected words should be displayed upon evaluation.

### goals
I wanted to develop a stronger basic UI using Material UI, but the time restrictions result in thus.
I expected to import the ogden data from the provided url, or deconstruct it from a local text file, but the mechanics of that are for a stretch another time. I would love to discuss it with you.

I would also prefer to store the related functions in a library and then import them into the component. 

I get nervous on time restrictions, so while I usually pseudocode first, I added in some after-the-fact comments to clarify what I was doing. Apologies for this. I also ended up working in a more circular manner than I would if I was working with a partner.
